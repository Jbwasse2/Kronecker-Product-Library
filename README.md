## Description
This library offers helpful functions for using the Kronecker Product. We have implemented an algorithm that can solve for $y=Ax$ in linear memory instead of exponential memory. A in this example is the Kronecker product of matrices $A_1 ... A_n$. Furthermore, functions have been written to help streamline using the properties of the Kronecker Product.
