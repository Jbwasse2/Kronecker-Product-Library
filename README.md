# MarkovChainAnalysis

Initially, we need the discrete Markov chain package for Markov chain analysis.

To install the discrete Markov chain package, one can use the following command:

pip install discreteMarkovChain

or the source distribution can be downloaded and installed manually with the command:

python setup.py install

For more info, we can follow this link: https://pypi.org/project/discreteMarkovChain/

We apply the Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm. The running time of this algorithm is linear.

To install the relevant package, we can use the following command:

easy_install tarjan

or from this source distribution, we can install with the command:

python setup.py install
